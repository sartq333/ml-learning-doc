### ml-learning-doc

This document would contain whatever advice/resources I’ve found useful in my ML journey. 

note that these are a lot of resources, which might feel overwhelming, even I haven't covered all of these things, so its fine, also you don't need these much resouces just search on youtube whatever topic you want to learn or not able to understand, watch the video on that topic, ask whatever doubts you've from chatgpt/sonnet. yes, use ai to learn about ai (recursion hehe). also learn and implement stuff - don't just keep learning, because implementation should also be done (i did this mistake in the starting, just learned and didn't applied much - but i realised this: how one can be sure that he knows things if he has just consumed stuff and not created anything, right?, not saying that create another sota model, but just start implementing whatever you can).

### Some really good advice:

- https://x.com/yoobinray/status/1844460463670886902

- https://x.com/daddynohara/status/1864513697424789574

- Try out competitions of Kaggle (one at a time), learn and collaborate with other people :).

- Learn git from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY

### books 

- download the python version: https://www.statlearning.com/ (to learn ml algos and math behind them)
- https://d2l.ai/ (to learn DL)
- this [book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tb2-tkoeO8Hcr34y_ABDAe2MyCOdW6oB/view?usp=sharing) by [nitin mukesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinmukeshiitb) for data science prep (interview prep guide).
- [class notes of statistics and probability](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14PJg_68luGKZ7pTWKLiayrMFqmZ1GGEc/view?usp=sharing) by professor amit kumar (note: there are some errors in this, so please be careful if you're reading or learning from this).
- books of packt, manning publications are also great (like sebestian's llm from scratch is pure goldmine, or modern computer vision with pytorch by packt publications).

- This document was quite helpful if you don’t prefer learning by books but still want to learn in structured manner: [Mech - ML community resource list.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uG3kMT51sEfZZAUatOvna_1uieaaK15z/view?usp=sharing), [ML RESOUCES-20250624T145356Z-1-001.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROdHTGgtuvN_igUWmqr8LUoZ-NNF-8BD/view?usp=sharing)

- Start writing about whatever you learn on websites like medium.com, because when you'll write down stuff, you'll realize that there are some gaps in your learning, and while pouring down your thoughts/understanding of concepts somewhere you'll try to fill those - and also other people might learn something useful from your writings, please note that don't write just for the sake of writing - or copy paste from chatgpt, write your *original/raw* thoughts!
