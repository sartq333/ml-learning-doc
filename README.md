### ml-learning-doc

This document would contain whatever advice/resources I’ve found useful in my ML journey:

### Some really good advice:

- https://x.com/daddynohara/status/1864513697424789574

- Try out competitions of Kaggle (one at a time), learn and collaborate with other people :).

### books 

- download the python version: https://www.statlearning.com/
- https://d2l.ai/
- this [book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tb2-tkoeO8Hcr34y_ABDAe2MyCOdW6oB/view?usp=sharing) by [nitin mukesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitinmukeshiitb) for data science prep.
- books of packt, manning publications are also great

- This document was quite helpful if you don’t prefer learning by books but still want to learn in structured manner: [Mech - ML community resource list.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uG3kMT51sEfZZAUatOvna_1uieaaK15z/view?usp=sharing), [ML RESOUCES-20250624T145356Z-1-001.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROdHTGgtuvN_igUWmqr8LUoZ-NNF-8BD/view?usp=sharing)

### dsa

DSA: Also practice regularly some questions (in python) related to arrays, string, greedy, dp from leetcode.com and also SQL. Learn about DSA from these 2 guys:
